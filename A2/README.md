# We are group 37 and we agree in feeling confident using python
# The claim for this assignment is taken from building project 2410, pm repport. The claim is found on page 21, where a figure shows the CO2 footprint for building materials. Make a LCA for the materials used in the building.

# The code should consist of two parts. First it should be able to extract quantities of different building components from the model, from this it should extract the materials in use. 
# Second part should apply CO2 footprint for the materials, here we expect to use some kind of external library with existing data. 
# The claim should be checked in the projecting/planning phase and it will rely on the quantites in the model to be correct. The main BIM purpose will be to gather quantities from the model, 
#and from this the material-LCA will be generated. Further more we would like to add a feature that in the early phase would be able to suggest improvement in terms of materials that could genrate a smaller footprint.
