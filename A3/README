While working with the IFC-models, a few problems appeared due to missing information in the models. At first a code was made that should retreive information about 
the volumes for a building element. Here it was noticed that the model XXX did not destinguish between the slaps and beams. The code was then made specifically to avoid any
element containing the word "slap". This was not considered to be a good general solution, but was nessesary for the code to work with the models available. 
A second problem occured when the material property was to be extracted for the element "Beam". There were no material associated with the beams.
