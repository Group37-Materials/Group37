While working with the IFC-models, a few problems appeared due to missing information in the models. At first a code was made that should retreive information about 
the volumes for a building element. Here it was noticed that the model CES_BLD_24_06_STR did not destinguish between the slaps and beams. The code was then changed to look for elements
containing a word, such as slap, beam or column. It should be noted that When running the code on model CES_BLD_24_06_STR and looking for "Beam", the slap is considered a beam, since this
is a specific problem with this model, the codes does not acount for this. 
Also some elements did not contain the propertie for the area or volume, therefore the code calculate these properties
using the x,y and z dimension, this should make the code work more generally.  
A second problem occured when the material property was to be extracted for the element "Beam". There were no material associated with the beams. Since the code should be made 
made as general as possible, it was decided to try to use it on another element, where the actual material could be retreived. The code should be able to work on any building 
element, if the model consist of the correct information. If the code is used on the element slap, instead of beam, the material and volume could be retreived correctly. 

STUFF WE MISS
some code that interact with the user
first input: "what element would you like to investegate"? beam/slap/column/wall ?
  output: number of elements, material type, volumen 
Second input: "would you like a CO2 calculation for steel ? wood ? concrete ? or All ?"
  output: "you have shosen XXX here is the total amount of this material/element"
Third input "would you like an calculation of the CO2 footprint ?"
  output: "co2 footprint"
