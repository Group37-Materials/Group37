While working with the IFC-models, a few problems appeared due to missing information in the models. At first a code was made that should retreive information about 
the volumes for a building element. Here it was noticed that the model XXX did not destinguish between the slaps and beams. The code was then made specifically to avoid any
element containing the word "slap". This was not considered to be a good general solution, but was nessesary for the code to work with the models available. 
A second problem occured when the material property was to be extracted for the element "Beam". There were no material associated with the beams. Since the code should be made 
made as general as possible, it was decided to try to use it on another element, where the actual material could be retreived. The code should be able to work on any building 
element, if the model consist of the correct information. If the code is used on the element slap, instead of beam, the material and volume could be retreived correctly.
