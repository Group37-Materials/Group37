It does feel like I have learned something, I would propable say that I have moved from a modeller to something between self-learner and a BIM-manager. I would like to have had some basic knowledge of Blender before taking the course, since I experineced a bit confusion trying to navigate in the properties given to the element in the models. I still need to actually create an IFC model, but i guess that is coming in the next semester:) 
I'm not in the process of thinking about the thesis yet, so i do not think this course helped me in that. 
The number of tools seemed ok, but in the beginning of the course I was a bit confused on wether the tools should be linked to each other, I could have used a bit more structure or a rød tråd.
Im very likely to use OpenBIM tools in my professional life. 
Wrap up from me
it has been slightly confusing, but i also enjoy having a course where we are more free to be creative. I think that our final results was ok. But there were times were i was not sure what was expected from the tools

did the tool address the use case you identified? Our tool managed to adress the use case.
