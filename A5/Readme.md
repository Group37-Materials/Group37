It does feel like I have learned something. I would probably say that I have transitioned from being a modeller to something between a self-learner and a BIM manager. I would have liked to have some basic knowledge of Blender before taking the course, as I experienced some confusion navigating the properties assigned to elements in the models. I still need to actually create an IFC model, but I assume that will come next semester. :)

I’m not currently thinking about my thesis, so I don’t feel this course contributed much in that regard.

The number of tools introduced seemed reasonable, but at the beginning of the course, I was a bit confused about whether the tools were supposed to be interconnected. I would have appreciated a bit more structure or a clearer rød tråd to tie everything together.

I am very likely to use OpenBIM tools in my professional life.

To wrap up: the course has been slightly confusing at times, but I also enjoyed having the freedom to be more creative. I think our final results were okay, but there were moments when I wasn’t sure what was expected from the tools.

The course introduced me to scripting and its role in sustainability, especially in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Starting with no experience in Blender or Python, I was unsure at first but soon became curious and motivated. The early assignments helped me learn basic concepts, while the later ones became more challenging. My main goal was to calculate material volumes and their CO2 emissions, which are essential for LCA.

To achieve this, I worked on extracting data and analyzing building models. At first, I used manual methods, but I quickly saw the benefits of automation. By using Python, I created scripts to measure and isolate building components. This helped improve my technical skills and showed me how digital tools can support sustainability.

One of the most interesting aspects of the course was how it encouraged students to be self-reliant. The structure pushed me to find solutions independently, rather than relying on detailed instructions or constant guidance. This approach not only strengthened my problem-solving abilities but also made me more confident in learning new tools and tackling unfamiliar challenges.

Looking back, I began the course with basic knowledge and saw myself as a beginner. By the end, I could confidently use the tools for material analysis and CO2 calculations. Although I have learned a lot, there is still more to explore, especially advanced techniques, which I look forward to studying in the future.

The course was a mix of positives and challenges. On one hand, I learned new skills like using Blender and Python for OpenBIM workflows. On the other hand, it sometimes felt unstructured, and I wasn’t always sure how everything fit together.

What I Learned
I learned how to calculate material volumes and CO2 emissions using scripts, which I think is a useful skill. The course gave me a glimpse into the potential of OpenBIM tools, especially in areas like sustainability and data analysis. Starting with little to no knowledge, I now have a basic understanding of how these tools work.

What I Still Need to Learn
There’s still a lot I need to improve on, like creating IFC models and understanding advanced scripting techniques. But I feel like I’m only scratching the surface of what’s possible.

OpenBIM in the Future
I can see OpenBIM being useful in professional projects, especially because of its focus on collaboration and efficiency. For my thesis, I did not yet figured out what i shall work with. 
Wrap-Up
Overall, the course introduced me to new tools and concepts. At times, I felt like there wasn’t enough guidance, and I had to figure things out on my own. While that was frustrating, it also forced me (as a student) to be more independent, which is a valuable skill in itself. I see this as a solid starting point, but there’s still a lot more to learn.
# Group question
did the tool address the use case you identified?
Yes, our tool addressed the use case, but with some limitations. We couldn't extract the volume directly from the model due to missing data, so the tool calculates volume based on the x, y, and z directions, making it suitable only for vertical and horizontal elements. This means it still needs improvements to work with all types of elements. It could also be interesting to make the script suitable to be used with other LCA programs, such as LCAbyg, to enhance its functionality.
# Wrap-up:
A1: In the beginning, our group decided to focus on materials-LCA. We spent some time learning Blender and Python, which helped us build the foundational skills and confidence we needed.

A2: We started planning how our code would work and what we wanted to achieve. We came up with a basic idea of how the script should function and what its purpose would be once it was finished.

A3: This assignment took up most of our time. We quickly realized that extracting volume directly from IFC models was difficult because of missing data in the models. This made us rethink our approach and focus on creating a more specific script to calculate the volume first and then the CO2 emissions.

A4: The tutorial we created aimed to help users install Blender and understand how to use our script. We also explained what the script does and how it can be applied.

A5: This assignment gave us the chance to reflect on the whole process. It helped us recognize our achievements and also pointed out areas where we could improve, giving us useful insights for applying OpenBIM in the future.
