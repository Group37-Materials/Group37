It does feel like I have learned something. I would probably say that I have transitioned from being a modeller to something between a self-learner and a BIM manager. I would have liked to have some basic knowledge of Blender before taking the course, as I experienced some confusion navigating the properties assigned to elements in the models. I still need to actually create an IFC model, but I assume that will come next semester. :)

I’m not currently thinking about my thesis, so I don’t feel this course contributed much in that regard.

The number of tools introduced seemed reasonable, but at the beginning of the course, I was a bit confused about whether the tools were supposed to be interconnected. I would have appreciated a bit more structure or a clearer rød tråd to tie everything together.

I am very likely to use OpenBIM tools in my professional life.

To wrap up: the course has been slightly confusing at times, but I also enjoyed having the freedom to be more creative. I think our final results were okay, but there were moments when I wasn’t sure what was expected from the tools.
